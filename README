sshbox: encrypt and decrypt files using OpenSSH keys.

sshbox is a utility to encrypt and decrypt files using OpenSSH keys. The
files may be PEM-encoded (ASCII-armoured) or DER-encoded (a binary
format). Public keys may be fetched over HTTP(S); however, private keys
must be local. sshbox uses cryptobox[1] as the underlying cryptographic
system. It uses the sshkey[2] package to load the keys.

The utility is designed for encryption smaller files (under 128M), as the
file is read into memory.

Password-protected keys aren't yet supported, and only RSA keys are
supported at this time.


Usage: sshbox [-ade] [-k key] source target
        -a=false: ASCII armour the box
        -d=false: decrypt file
        -e=false: encrypt file
        -k="": SSH key file
        -s="": SSH private key for signing
        -v="": SSH public for signature verification
